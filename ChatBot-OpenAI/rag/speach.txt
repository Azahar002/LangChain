**Title:** *The Power of Small Steps*

Good morning everyone,

When we think about success, we often imagine giant leaps — moments of dramatic change or overnight breakthroughs. But the truth is, most great achievements aren’t born in a single leap. They’re built, brick by brick, in the quiet persistence of small steps.

Every time you wake up a little earlier, choose to try again after a failure, or push yourself when you’d rather quit — you’re making progress. You may not see the results right away, but like drops of water carving stone, your daily actions are shaping your future.

The biggest obstacle isn’t the size of your dream, it’s the doubt that whispers, *“It’s too far.”* The answer to that doubt is simple: take the next step. And then the next. Because success isn’t about how fast you move, but how consistently you keep moving.

So today, don’t wait for the perfect moment. Take the imperfect step. Trust that your persistence will lead you where passion alone cannot.

The journey of a thousand miles doesn’t begin with a giant leap. It begins with a single step — and you are ready to take it.

Thank you.
